# Loading-animation
The aim of this project is to create a set of minimal instruction to display loading spinners automatically on top of the page to hide the loading process.
The project also provide a collection of loading spinners animated with CSS.
# How it works?
A fixed div is created at index.html to mask the page when loading. Other elements are added to that div. CSS3 animations are used to animate them.
# How to setup

Place loading css link on top of the `body` before other js codes or CSS codes .
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
```
